                <h3>Childhood </h3>
                <p>Schieble gave birth to Jobs on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco and chose an adoptive couple for
                    him that was "Catholic, well-educated, and wealthy,but the couple later changed their
                    mind.Jobs was then placed with Paul and Clara Jobs, neither of whom had a college education,
                    and Schieble refused to sign the adoption papers. She then took the matter to court in an
                    attempt to have her baby placed with a different family, and only consented to releasing the
                    baby to Paul and Clara after the couple pledged to pay for the boy's college education. Steve's
                    first cousin, Bassma Al Jandaly, maintains that his birth name was Abdul Lateef Jandali.
                    In his youth, Steve's parents took him to a Lutheran church. When Steve Jobs was in high school,
                    Clara admitted to his girlfriend, Chrisann Brennan, that she "was too frightened to love [Steve] for
                    the first six months of his life ... I was scared they were going to take him away from me. Even
                    after we won the case, Steve was so difficult a child that by the time he was two I felt we had made
                    a mistake. I wanted to return him." When Chrisann shared this comment with Steve, he stated that
                    he was already aware, and would later say he was deeply loved and indulged by Paul and
                    Clara. Many years later, Steve Jobs's wife Laurene also noted that "he felt he had
                    been really blessed by having the two of them as parents." Jobs would become upset
                    when Paul and Clara were referred to as his "adoptive parents"; he regarded them as his parents
                    "1,000%". With regard to his biological parents, Jobs referred to them as "my sperm and egg bank.
                    That's not harsh, it's just the way it was, a sperm bank thing, nothing more.<br><br></p>

                <h3>High School </h3>
                <p>The location of the Los Altos home meant that Jobs would be able to attend nearby Homestead High
                    School, which had strong ties to Silicon Valley. He began his first year there in late 1968
                    along with Bill Fernandez.(Fernandez introduced Jobs to Steve Wozniak, and would
                    later be Apple's first employee.) Neither Jobs nor Fernandez (whose father was a lawyer) came from
                    engineering households and thus decided to enroll in John McCollum's "Electronics 1
                    McCollum and the rebellious Jobs (who had grown his hair long and become involved in the
                    growing counterculture) would eventually clash and Jobs began to lose interest in the
                    class.He underwent a change during mid-1970: "I got stoned for the first time; I discovered
                    Shakespeare,
                    Dylan Thomas, and all that classic stuff. I read Moby Dick and went back as a junior taking creative
                    writing classes.Jobs also later noted to his official biographer that "I started
                    to listen to music a whole lot, and I started to read more outside of just science and
                    technology—Shakespeare, Plato. I loved King Lear ... when I was a senior I had this phenomenal AP
                    English class. The teacher was this guy who looked like Ernest Hemingway. He took a bunch of us
                    snowshoeing in Yosemite. During his last two years at Homestead High, Jobs developed two
                    different interests: electronics and literature. These dual interests were particularly
                    reflected during Jobs's senior year as his best friends were Wozniak and his first girlfriend, the
                    artistic Homestead junior Chrisann Brennan.[citation needed]<br><br><br></p>
